    <p>Hello, my name is Roman, and it's dangerous to go alone!.
    <p>Here is my first wepbage. Feel free to look around.
    <p>As you can see, it's nothing much, but it might be just enough to get an idea of what kind of person I am. 
    <p>I've have to say, gaming is great. I've been playing many games ever since I was a kid, and still enjoy doing so as of now.
    <p>I'm going to go over some of my favorite games and game series that I liked the most. I'm going to start of with my favorites and go down from there.

      <li>The Legend of Zelda series. A whole different topic of it's own. I love talking about all 19 games in this amazing series.
      <li>Skyrim. Beautifully crafted game. Amazing story, lots to do, big, open-world game. 
      <li>Destiny 2. I have a love/hate relationship with this game but it still managed to take 800+ hours of my life away from me.
      <li>Stranded Deep. Originally made for Pc, it came to console a while ago and I really am enjoying it. A suprisingly realistic survival game that makes you want to keep playing.
      <li>Star Wars BF1 and 2. Played this awesome game when I was a little older. But being a Star Wars nerd and lover of FPS's, this game is totally for me.
